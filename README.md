*DESCRIPTION*: For Task 2 of my CodTech AI internship, I developed a Speech-to-Text System designed to automatically convert spoken audio into written text using pre-trained models and open-source Python libraries. The main objective of this task is to demonstrate how artificial intelligence can interpret and transcribe human speech, which is a fundamental feature in modern voice assistants, transcription services, and many AI-driven applications.

To implement this task, I used Python as the primary programming language and carried out the development and testing process on Google Colab, a cloud-based notebook platform. Google Colab is ideal for machine learning and AI projects because it provides a free, ready-to-use environment with pre-installed libraries and access to powerful computation resources. This means I could run my speech recognition code easily without worrying about setting up packages on my local system.

For the speech-to-text conversion, I used the popular SpeechRecognition Python library. This library offers a simple interface to various speech recognition engines and APIs. For this task, I used Google’s free Web Speech API through SpeechRecognition because it is accurate, easy to set up, and suitable for short audio clips.

The implementation process was straightforward yet insightful. First, I installed the SpeechRecognition library inside my Google Colab notebook. I then used the Colab file upload feature to upload a sample audio file. For testing, I recorded a short .wav file that says, “Hey, this is a sample test for speech recognition.” In some cases, if the audio is in .mp3 format, I used the pydub library to convert it to .wav since the recognizer works more reliably with .wav files.
